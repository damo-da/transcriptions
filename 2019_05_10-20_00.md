Om chant.

There are all kinds of people: people who have more brains than me and people who have less brains. In a sense, I am an average kind of human. Every aspect of what I do including this, is already somewhere.

### 4m50
And everything that I think I know, somebody else already did think about it. 

### 6m
Maybe I should start a blog writing all of my thoughts. Just the recordings and transcripts on my website.

### 10m26
Maybe my ideologies could be wrong. For example, right now, I am slacking off saying that I should completely enjoy while 
eating. And that drives my focus off the thing that I 
want to do. And therefore, I am slacking off.

Meditation is just a thing taught to me by others.
It is not the salvation.
I shouldn't take it too seriously.
I am only a mere human being. 

I am a man in my mind.
I am an animal.
I am living in the earth.

I am made up of atoms, I am made of proteins.
The same proteins which we can find in other animals.
Which we can find in bacteria. Which we can find in every
living things including trees. I eat trees to make myself.

The trees exist because of equilibrium. It is just the universe is 
made to be. It is just the way the laws of physics do.

I was born smart. I am lucky. The rules of cosmos mainly randomness
favor me. Well, anyone can use the anthropic principle for difference.
But it doesn't actually give us anything. I do not understand it rather.

### 19m53
What comes that goes. I realized this principle after which it became 
a part of me. In a similar manner, I will understand new things and I 
will change. So now, I want to look into what attributes I will loose and what attributes I will strengthen. 

First, family. Ever since I went to Nepal, family means a lot to me. 
They are the reasons why I existed. And why I am thinking about them.
In a sense, family is an essential element to make consciousness alive.
And I have to go back as a tribute. For them. Right now, I am focusing 
on my role as a human being. And I am a role, and that is what I accept.
I perform my duties and that is all I do. I am not the body and I am not even the mind.

There is no I in thins world. We are all just atoms. And nothing else. 
Just atoms. Just the law. There is nothing more than the law. There is no
I. I was never here. And will never be. Consciousness can not live.
