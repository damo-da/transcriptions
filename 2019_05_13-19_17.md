Now, there is a different thing that I would like to talk about. It is a parameter set in us. 
It is how much we own the world. In one hand, we can 
feel like we own things, relationships, and knowledge. While in 
the other hand, we can act like a brainwashed-by evolution--and one who does not 
think about owning anything.

There must a best point for this parameter, unless proven otherwise. So either I
 lack some knowledge about this parameter, or there must be a best point.

Pause. I just realized the kind of brainwashed I am. I think knowledge is

Right now, I am recording with a cigarette in my hand. I am talking while the AC
fan is running and making its noise as usual. The smoke from the cigarette is 
passing in front of my nose, and the universe is doing what it always does. 
Even this processing recording is part of the universe's role. Everything, 
including the way my hand is right in front of me and the reason why I can see, 
is physics. Nothing but the laws. And where are the laws there? Isn't that 
interesting? Doesn't that require a supreme creator? All of us: both theists 
and non-theists, believe in a form of a supreme: whether it be a 
physical person, or maybe just his acts, or a god embedded in the universe itself.

Or maybe into knowledge, like I belive.

But you know what, all of this is just a process. Just a process, and nothing 
else. I am thoughtless right now, and this is my meditation. Which suggests that
I have become a philosopher.
