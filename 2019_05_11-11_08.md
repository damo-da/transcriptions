2) (unrecorded)

3) My mouth is dehydrated

4) In front of me, there are atoms. Atoms are interacting, moving. 
That is why we see the colors, there is heat, and there is sound.

6) Birds are seeing.

7) And the wilderness, the phenomena of growth of grass is unstoppable by 
civilization no matter how developed it is.
