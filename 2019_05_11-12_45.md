In order to plan for my future, I listed the topics I like. For example, 
cosmology, philosophy, psychology, history, and so on. And I drew ~a chart~ lines
to represent correlations between these fields. And now, what I need to do, 
is to draw a diagram which can represent the percentage of overlap between 
these fields. From there, I can choose the field with maximum number of intersections
with what I like. And that is what I need to do in ~~the fu[ture]~~ career because 
that is what I love the most.
