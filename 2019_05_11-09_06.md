One of the key things in life is change. ~~At some time in my past, I used to think~~
About a year ago, I used to think that after I changed, I understood everything.
But I have gone through ~~so~~ many phases of these changes, and I have realized that
I am going to continue changing for a long time. 

And I will be learning new things and new things and ~~none of them~~ not one single of them is right. 

Therefore, to plan for your future, remember that you are going to change and 
anticipate that change. And think about how you're going to change. And if you 
prepare for it, maybe the change will come earlier. And in that sense, you'll
reach your goal sooner.
