It doesn't matter where I am going to. It is does not matter whether the universe 
is endless. However, since I am a human, I must know how to predict my 
future. I must be able to see what is going to come into my life to live a satisfactory life.
One of them is to find a cure for loneliness if it touches me in the future. 
Right now, I have my family and friends supporting me, but, who knows, I might 
feel lonely in the future. So I need to plan ahead and study loneliness.
