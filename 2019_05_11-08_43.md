I tell everyone that I'm so busy. But one day I will realize that 
communication is very important. And that when they message me, I should 
reply them right away.

### 4m30
And right after this meditation session, I should reply to (my employer).

### 6m20
I need to do a lot of planning and looking into my future. Looking through
all the possibilities, and choose the one that I want, and move towards it.

### 6m39
Let me get obsessed with future.

### 8m12
Everything negative has a priority and so does every positive. It is in their nature.
And while there are both things to do, while judging between positive and negative,
do not forget that priorities exist.

### 9m37
My stomach is empty.

### 11m15
Let thoughts come. It is part of the process. I accept it.

And I want to give them what they want. I don't hate them; I love them.
