### 0m40
May 14, 2019 of the Gregorian Calendar. Located at planet earth, rotating in 
its own axis, as well as revolving around the sun which is by itself revolving
around the center of our milky way. Which is by itself revolving around the center 
of our local cluster. Maybe space is just a Euclidean plane and we are an 
arbritrarily defined center! 

### 1m45
Are we just points in this space with given veolocities and configuration? Was 
math invented or discovered? 

### 3m13
I have lost a lot of myself while growing up. A part of me is already dead; and as 
I age, I will gain new parts while losing who I am. It is the continuous process,
which happens, for the better as well as for the worse. 

### 5m00
And it is time to change myself now. I finally figured out what I need to do
during this summer. It is not a time to let go of my emotions. It is not a time 
to let go of my goal. It is rather a time to develop curiosity. It's my most 
dearest loss over the years. 

### 7m51
To meditate is to understand what I am. All the things which have shaped me as 
well as are shaping me right now. 

### 8m27
To sit down to meditate is true escape.

### 8m46
In space, it does not mean anything to be moving as far as we know. So I 
can be the centre of the universe at rest while everyone and everything else is 
moving. Is space infinite? Is space infinite? Is space infinite?

### 10m28
As being a mere part of the process, there is one thing which strikes me. We 
are all limited, and one of our limit is our field of vision. Maybe we can be 
see better with glasses, binoculars, telescopes, or through precise scientific 
instruments. But there will always a limit of what we can see. The biggest limit 
right now are the horizons of our observable universe. But what if the new galaxies 
formed by the extension of the horizon of our observable universe was new matter?
(However, it is likely to have a contradiction with their age.)

### 12m12
Why do we exist? Or maybe a better question to ask ourselves, is why the universe 
exists. The universe exists. For without the universe, we can not be.
