I have the power to succeed. I have the power to motivate people. Motivating 
people is probably one of the greatest  Seva that I can do. But I can only choose
 either choose to 
pursue knowledge and keep my emotions on what I want to learn in check, or 
I can let go of everything. And think that if I do something great, I will
inspire other people. And henceforth, I will be doing Seva. So I need to think
about this during the summer.

* Relationship
* Communication with family (although it is improving)
